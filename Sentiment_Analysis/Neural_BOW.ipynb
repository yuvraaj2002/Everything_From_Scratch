    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. The primary goal of sentiment analysis is to classify the text into different categories based on the sentiment it conveys, such as positive, negative, or neutral. "
